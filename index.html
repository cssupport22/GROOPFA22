<p><strong>CSC-133 Section 03 :: Fall 2022 :: On-Campus</strong></p>
<p>This is not the full syllabus. The full syllabus will be posted soon and will be available to enrolled students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is<span>&nbsp;</span><em><strong>an on-campus course</strong></em>. Lecture content will be delivered in the classroom. Generally, lectures will not be recorded for this section. Some lecture/demo video content will be provided as supplementary content. Assessment for this course is a combination of a number of online quizzes, some introductory programming assignments, and a larger project.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Un-Enrolled Students</strong><br />If you need to send me an email then please send it from your official CSUS email address. &nbsp;Email sent from outside the university is filtered and may not be read in a timely manner, if at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Textbooks<br /></strong>We will be using several textbooks for this course. <em><strong>All of the required material is freely available on the web </strong></em>and does not require you to purchase anything if you prefer to use the electronic versions. We will take some additional content from some other free resources as well, to be determined. Further, I will recommend some other books that you may consider if you're interested. For those books, however, we will only be using the author's freely available code in class.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>First Textbook</strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="https://github.com/cssupport22/javanotes9/blob/master/javanotes9/javanotes9-cover-518x675.jpg?raw=true" alt="javanotes9-cover-518x675.jpg" width="344" height="448" /></strong></p>
<p>The first textbook for this course is David Eck's Java Notes 9, JavaFX edition. We will not be covering all of this text as the first half of the book is really a Java introduction/review. The primary use for this book will be as an introduction and review of basic OOP ideas, and as an introductory text for JavaFX. This book is entirely free and you may <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download the pdf from the author's website</a>. If you wish, you may order a printed copy, however, this is certainly not required. At last check the printed copy of this text was under $30.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>Transfer students</strong></em>: If you did not cover Java at your institution, please review, at minimum, the first four chapters of this book to get yourself up to speed. I recommend that you tackle a number of the coding exercises provided at the end of each chapter.<br /><br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Second Textbook</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/cover-hires/book/978-3-030-24094-3" alt="Book cover" width="336" height="510" /></p>
<p>The second textbook for this course is&nbsp;<a class="inline_disabled external" href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-24094-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Introduction To Software Design with Java</span></a>. &nbsp;The full version of this textbook is not required<strong><i>. </i></strong>The author of this textbook provides significant portions of the course notes that inspired this book for free on the <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://github.com/prmr/SoftwareDesign" target="_blank" rel="noopener">author's Github site</a> and our use in the course will be limited to that freely available content. For those of you who like to explore concepts more in depth, the full version of the book does provide some additional insight and you may find this helpful. Note that although there is a second edition of the book, it is not significantly different from the first edition.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Third Textbook</strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="https://assets.lulu.com/cover_thumbs/1/j/1jzn2z5r-front-shortedge-384.jpg" width="324" height="420" /></strong></p>
<p>The third textbook that we will be using in the course is David Eck's introduction to computer graphics. We will not be using all of this book as its primary focus is on 3d graphics. However, the 2D material covers significant ground. Again, this is a free textbook and you can download the pdf directly from <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://math.hws.edu/graphicsbook/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the author's web page</a>. Again, if you prefer, you may order a printed copy but this is not required.&nbsp;</p>
